## 2024-05-18 - [Optimization of ECSWorld.query]

**Learning:** The previous ECS design relied on an `Iterator[Entity]` for `query(...)`, forcing callers in hot paths to wrap it in a materialized `list()` to prevent "Set changed size during iteration" errors since components could be mutated or updated concurrently in game loops. CPython actually evaluates list comprehensions with inline `[]` significantly faster than wrapping a generator in `list()`.
**Action:** Changed `world.query` to return a materialized `list[Entity]` directly using fast-path list comprehensions. This successfully removed the `list()` wrappers at call sites, making queries noticeably faster and removing boilerplate while implicitly preserving thread and mutation safety.

## 2025-02-25 - ECS Single-Component Query Fast-Path Optimization

**Learning:** The ECS engine heavily queries entities by single component types (e.g., `world.query(SwarmComponent)`) in the simulation hot loop across lifecycle, interaction, and signaling phases. The original implementation used a generalized multi-component check involving `min()`, `all()`, and set building, creating significant overhead for single-component queries.
**Action:** Added an early-exit fast path in `ECSWorld.query` for `len(component_types) == 1`, allowing direct iteration over `_component_index`, yielding a 6-7x speedup for the majority of queries without affecting multi-component functionality. Copied the set into a list before iterating to avoid runtime mutation errors since components may be added or removed during loops.

## 2025-02-26 - Python Flat List vs Dict & NumPy for spatial indexing

**Learning:** During profiling of the O(1) crowding lookups (`tile_populations`) in the interaction phase, I found that using a flat Python list (`[0] * (env.width * env.height)`) accessed via `list[y * width + x]` is ~2-3x faster than the original `dict` keyed by `(x, y)` tuples due to avoiding tuple creation and hashing overhead. Interestingly, it also marginally outperformed using a 2D NumPy array (`np.zeros((width, height), dtype=np.int32)`) for this specific workload, because modifying NumPy elements iteratively from pure Python incurs slight C-API overhead unless the operation is vectorized or fully JIT-compiled.
**Action:** When tracking dense, integer-based scalar state that must be updated iteratively within pure Python logic without Numba or vectorization (like spatial population accumulation), pre-allocating a flat Python list often provides the fastest mutable caching structure.

## 2024-07-02 - Zensical Documentation and Mermaid

Learning: The Python test suite for `test_batch_runner.py` contains a test (`test_run_single_headless_breaks_when_termination_detected`) that is structurally broken in the repository's base state regarding the `_FakeLoop` constructor signature (missing `disable_replay` kwarg acceptance), which initially caused pytest failures.
Action: When modifying purely documentation files inside `docs/`, utilize targeted test running (`pytest tests/ <target_file>`) or explicitly note that existing integration test failures are disjoint from documentation updates. Do not attempt to fix unrelated tests in documentation PRs.

## 2024-05-18 - [Optimization of ECSWorld.query multi-component checks]

**Learning:** The previous ECS design used `min()` to find the smallest component set, then checked for intersection using `all(...)` across all components inside a list comprehension. This iteration and function call in python is slow. A better approach is to sort the component index sets by length and use Python's C-level `set.intersection_update()` down an initial copied set, which significantly outperforms purely iterating via list comprehensions with `all()` component checks.
**Action:** Changed the multi-component logic in `ECSWorld.query` to use `set.intersection_update()`. This significantly improves the execution speed of multi-component checks.

## 2026-07-17 - Optimize ECS Query Fast-Path

Learning: Iterating through an ECS component index and doing secondary lookup checks like `if eid in entities and ct in entities[eid]._components` is slow inside hot loops. Because the ECS is carefully managed, `_component_index` is strictly synchronized with `_entities`.
Action: Rely on invariant synchronization to safely drop defensive dictionary lookups in hot path queries. Fail-fast on desynchronization rather than silently masking it with `if in` checks.

## 2026-07-20 - Avoid Boolean Array and Sum Allocations in Numpy

**Learning:** During profiling of the double-buffering execution in the ECS simulation engine, I discovered that basic Numpy checks like `np.any(layer >= SIGNAL_EPSILON)` silently allocate large temporary boolean arrays of shape `(width, height)`. Similarly, operations like `ndarray.sum(axis=0)` allocate a brand new array every single tick before it gets copied into the write buffer using `[:] =`. These repeated allocations accumulate significant latency over thousands of ticks.
**Action:** Instead of `np.any(layer >= val)`, use `layer.max() >= val` which operates directly on the array and returns a scalar without allocating a boolean mask. Instead of `array.sum(axis=0)`, use `np.sum(array, axis=0, out=target_buffer)` to sum directly into the pre-allocated double-buffer output array. This fundamentally avoids dynamic allocation during the deterministic hot path.

## 2026-07-20 - Eliminate ECS Dictionary Lookups in Interaction Spatial Hash

**Learning:** In the interaction phase, when checking if a swarm is "anchored" (standing on compatible, uneaten food), the engine used `world.entities_at(swarm.x, swarm.y)` to get entity IDs and then performed dictionary lookups and method calls (`world.has_entity`, `world.get_entity`, `has_component`) to find a valid `PlantComponent`. This overhead in the hot path is entirely avoidable because `GridEnvironment` already maintains `apparent_nutrition_layer` and `plant_energy_by_species` which perfectly reflect the current ECS state (including deaths in the same tick).
**Action:** Replaced the ECS spatial hash collision checks in `_is_swarm_anchored` with direct array lookups into `GridEnvironment` layers. This eliminated slow Python loop overhead and ECS queries, yielding an additional ~2.66% increase in tick throughput.

## 2026-07-20 - Hoist Numba Loop Bounds Checking

**Learning:** In deeply nested Numba `@njit` kernels like the 2D convolution for signal diffusion (`_numba_diffuse_signal_layer`), bounds checks computed inside the innermost loop significantly hinder LLVM's ability to vectorize instructions. By computing `ax = x - i` and checking `0 <= ax < width` immediately in the outer loop before entering the inner `j` loop, we eliminate 20 unnecessary `if` evaluations per cell evaluation (dropping from 25 conditional checks to just 5 per cell).
**Action:** Hoisted the X-axis bounds check out of the inner loop in the reaction-diffusion kernel. This trivial change measurably improved execution speed, making the application roughly 2.15% faster by reducing branch mispredictions and unlocking better inner-loop vectorization.

## 2026-07-20 - Unnecessary Tuple Allocation in Read-Only Component Passes

**Learning:** During the `interaction` system, the engine was iterating over `tuple(world._component_index.get(SwarmComponent, set()))` for an initial read-only population accumulation pass. While wrapping the component index set in a tuple is strictly necessary when the loop modifies the ECS (to avoid "Set changed size during iteration" errors), doing this on a purely read-only pass introduces an unnecessary O(N) allocation per tick (where N is the number of swarms).
**Action:** Always identify whether an ECS loop mutates the world state. If it is purely read-only (e.g., just accumulating metrics or building read caches), iterate directly over the component index set without wrapping it in a `list` or `tuple` to save per-tick allocation overhead.

## 2026-07-20 - [Avoid np.sum(axis=0) allocation in flow field computation]

**Learning:** Calling  inside  allocates a new  NumPy array every single simulation tick on the hot path before passing it to the Numba kernel.
**Action:** Move the reduction directly into the Numba  kernel by passing the 3D array () directly and iterating over its first dimension inside the nested grid loop. This computes the local scalar sum inline (e.g., ) and strictly eliminates a full array allocation on the deterministic simulation hot path, yielding ~7% speedup in the JIT execution mode.

## 2024-05-18 - [Avoid np.sum(axis=0) allocation in flow field computation]

**Learning:** Calling `toxin_layers.sum(axis=0)` inside `compute_flow_field` allocates a new `(width, height)` NumPy array every single simulation tick on the hot path before passing it to the Numba kernel.
**Action:** Move the reduction directly into the Numba `@njit` kernel by passing the 3D array (`toxin_layers`) directly and iterating over its first dimension inside the nested grid loop. This computes the local scalar sum inline (e.g., `t_sum += toxin_layers[t, x, y]`) and strictly eliminates a full array allocation on the deterministic simulation hot path, yielding ~7% speedup in the JIT execution mode.

## 2026-07-23 - [Avoid absolute value function call overhead in tight Numba loops]

**Learning:** During profiling of the `_truncate_subnormals_jit` function in the reaction-diffusion flow-field generator, using `abs(current[x, y]) < threshold` incurred unnecessary function-call overhead that negatively impacted auto-vectorization and loop pipelining within the inner bounds of a 2D `(width, height)` nested array traversal.
**Action:** Replaced `abs(val) < threshold` with the inline logical equivalent `val > -threshold and val < threshold`. This seemingly minor pure-Python-level restructuring directly translates to a faster, branching LLVM IR layer when processed by Numba `@njit`, yielding a consistent +1-2% measurable throughput boost to the overall engine cycle time on dense deterministic scenarios.

## 2026-07-23 - [Remove redundant bounds check in tile population accumulation]

**Learning:** In `_accumulate_tile_population`, a runtime boundary check (`0 <= x < width and 0 <= y < (len(tile_populations) // width)`) was being evaluated for every single swarm movement, reproduction, and initialization event per tick. However, swarm entities in the ECS are already strictly constrained within the grid boundaries mathematically by the movement systems (e.g. `_random_walk_step` and `_choose_neighbour_by_flow_probability`). Re-evaluating these bounds, especially with a division operation to calculate height, creates pure overhead on the interaction hot-path.
**Action:** Removed the redundant boundary checks in `_accumulate_tile_population` to execute the flat list index mutation directly, yielding roughly a ~5% increase in JIT throughput on dense scenarios. When updating arrays or lists using coordinates generated by rigorously tested movement functions, trust the mathematical invariants and avoid defensive bounds checking in the hot path.

## 2026-08-05 - [Cache Pydantic model serialization in hot loop]

**Learning:** During profiling of the engine loop, I noticed that `model_dump(mode="json")` inside `TriggerConditionSchema` took a measurable amount of execution time every tick for every flora instance during the signaling phase. The trigger schemas are static during simulation but are evaluated repeatedly.
**Action:** Replaced dynamic per-tick Pydantic dumps with a static cached representation calculated once during engine initialization. Created `CompiledTrigger` dataclass containing `schema` and `activation_condition_dump`. This entirely eliminated the overhead of runtime Pydantic schema serialization from the ECS simulation hot path.

## 2026-08-12 - [Faster defensive copies for set iteration in ECS hot loops]

**Learning:** When making a defensive copy of a component set before iterating in a tight ECS hot loop (where mutations like `collect_garbage` might alter the original set and raise `RuntimeError: Set changed size during iteration`), `list(component_set)` is significantly faster than `tuple(component_set)`. CPython's list allocation is highly optimized and often reuses internal memory buffers, whereas `tuple` construction from an unknown-sized iterable involves additional overhead. In microbenchmarks on large component sets, `list()` outperforms `tuple()` by roughly 30%.
**Action:** Always use `list(world._component_index.get(..., set()))` instead of `tuple(...)` when you need a mutable-safe snapshot of ECS component IDs for iteration on the hot path.
