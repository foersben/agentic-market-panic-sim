Welcome to the autonomous nervous system of the Agentic Market Panic Simulator (AMPS). This repository is not maintained by a single monolithic Artificial Intelligence; instead, it is driven by an ecosystem of decoupled, narrow-jurisdiction AI specialists.

Our philosophy relies on **strict discipline and separation of concerns**. By dividing problem-solving into granular roles guided by absolute invariants (our Rule Engine), we prevent the architectural drift, hallucinated dependencies, and catastrophic looping often seen in general-purpose coding LLMs. Here, agents collaborate, delegate, verify their work against hard automated gates, and systematically log their learnings.

## 2. Team Directory: Roles & Jurisdictions

The AMPS workspace is governed by 10 distinct specialist roles. When you submit a request, it is intercepted, deconstructed, and routed to the appropriate domain expert.

## 3. Guardrails: The Rule Engine

Agents operate within an ironclad set of core invariants located in `.agents/rules/`. These rules are non-negotiable and override standard agent impulses.

* **Python Modernization (`00`)**: Prevents the use of legacy tools. Agents must strictly use `uv run` and `just`, enforce `mypy` typings, and validate code via `ruff`.
* **Stochastic Engine & Replay (`01`)**: Ensures absolute determinism. All tick outcomes are written to the `_write` layer (double-buffering) and logged to Zarr replay buffers to guarantee flawless serialization.
* **Numba Constraints (`02`)**: Maintains the execution speed of our JIT hot-paths. It bans Python objects inside `@njit` boundaries, enforces pre-allocation, and mandates float masking for state transitions.
* **Git Security & Signing (`03`)**: Mandates cryptographic GPG/SSH signatures on all commits. Agents are instructed to halt and escalate to a human operator rather than bypass failed signatures.
* **Data-Flow Invariants (`05`)**: Enforces Table-to-Trace Parity (Rule 05-A), Branchless SIMD Float Masks (Rule 05-B), and Bilateral OKF Resource Mapping (Rule 05-C).

## 4. Collaboration: Workflows & The Delegation Protocol

To prevent recursive loops or fragmented development, agents pass tasks via established workflows located in `.agents/workflows/`.

### The Vertical Slice Development Workflow

This pipeline ensures a new ecological feature is implemented securely across the entire stack. A concept moves from the Scientific Architect's models directly into the Engine Developer's JIT loops, gets wired to Telemetry, exposed via the API Developer's UI, and strictly verified by QA-simultaneously.

### Matrix-Driven TDD Refactoring

Coordinated 4-stage pipeline translating conceptual behavior into formal Data-Flow Matrix tables, failing Pytest trace fixtures, branchless Numba array kernels, and verified OKF resource mappings.

### Automated Matrix Drift Reconciliation

Automated recovery workflow detecting numerical drift between telemetry traces and documented matrix tables, generating candidate markdown diffs for one-click operator approval.

### The Delegation Protocol

When an agent encounters a structurally blocked task (e.g., an interactive MFA prompt, or a missing GPG key), they use the **Delegation Protocol**. Instead of guessing or failing silently, the agent outputs a highly structured markdown checklist of the exact context, instructions, and resumption signals for the human operator to complete the manual gate.

## 5. Automated Quality Gates & Skills

Our repository does not rely on agent promises; it relies on automated enforcement scripts found in `.agents/skills/`. Before any code is committed, it must survive pre-commit hooks and explicit programmatic skills.

* **Run Benchmarks (`run-benchmarks`):** Evaluates `pytest-benchmark` execution speeds to reject any code that degrades the performance of the spatial hashing loops.
* **Analyze Zarr (`analyze-zarr`):** Inspects Zarr schemas to guarantee telemetry replays match active loop data.
* **Validate OKF (`validate-okf`):** A critical gate enforcing our implementation of the Open Knowledge Format (OKF v0.2).
* **Verify Matrix Trace Parity (`verify-matrix-trace-parity`):** Parses Markdown Data-Flow Matrix tables and asserts point-by-point numerical parity against Pytest traces.
* **Audit OKF Matrix Coverage (`audit-okf-matrix-coverage`):** Scans concept documents in `docs/scientific_model/` and reports state shifts missing matrix tables.
* **Auto Reconcile Matrix Drift (`auto-reconcile-matrix-drift`):** Captures runtime traces and auto-updates Markdown table rows when parameters drift.

### The OKF Validation Pipeline

The `validate_okf.py` script inspects all documentation files to guarantee they possess correct YAML frontmatter and that they do not contain dangling or escaping markdown links.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Agent(Agent Modifies Docs) --> Hook{Pre-commit Trigger}
    Hook -->|Runs| OKF[validate_okf.py]

    OKF --> Frontmatter{Check YAML}
    OKF --> Graph{Check Links}

    Frontmatter -->|Pass| Graph
    Frontmatter -->|Fail| Reject[Reject Build]

    Graph -->|Valid internal| Accept[Accept Build]
    Graph -->|External/Escaping| Reject
```

### 🔗 Link Validation Reference Examples

To ensure your documentation passes the `validate_okf.py` build gates, strictly format your links according to these rules:

```markdown
# ✅ VALID LINK (Relative internal path)
[Engine Architecture](../docs/okf/README.md)

# ❌ INVALID LINK (External web protocol)
[External Reference](https://example.com/docs)
<!-- Error: Target path escapes authorized knowledge domains -->

# ❌ INVALID LINK (Escaping repository boundary)
[Secret File](../../../etc/passwd)
<!-- Error: Target path escapes authorized knowledge domains -->
```

## 6. Memory Paradigms: How Context Persists

Multi-agent conversations are ephemeral. To maintain long-term coherence across sessions, agents persist their context using tightly controlled markdown files inside `.agents/memory/`.

### The Architecture State Map

The `architecture_state_map.md` acts as our global lockfile. Before initiating major refactors, the Orchestrator checks this file to avoid clashing with ongoing migrations. **Protocol:** Agents must update this map when opening or closing major architectural tasks.

* *Example Context:* Currently tracking the active migration to Python 3.13 and the switch to `uv` for dependency management.

### Agent Performance Journals

Individual agents maintain their own hyper-focused journals (e.g., `bolt.md` for engine performance, `palette.md` for UI/UX lessons).

* **Protocol:** These files are **not routine activity logs**. They are reserved exclusively for logging high-value architectural lessons structured as `Learning:` and `Action:` pairs. This prevents the logs from bloating while preserving crucial micro-lessons (like ECS query optimizations) for future reference.
