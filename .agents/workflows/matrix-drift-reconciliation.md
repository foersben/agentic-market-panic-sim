# Sequence

1. **Drift Detection (`@causal-verifier`):** Detect numerical drift between simulation telemetry trace and documented Markdown matrix tables during background CI or DSE runs.
2. **Candidate Diff Generation (`@matrix-auditor`):** Execute skill `auto-reconcile-matrix-drift` to capture the new trace output and generate an updated Markdown table diff.
3. **Review & Alignment (`@orchestrator`):** Present the reconciled table diff to the user for explicit approval.
4. **Git Sign & Commit (`@git-operator`):** Commit and push the approved specification update with a GPG-signed commit.
