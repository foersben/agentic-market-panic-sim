# Directives

- **ECS Strictness:** Enforce ECS: Components MUST be raw NumPy arrays; Systems contain all logic and operate on component arrays. Ban classes with behavior/state inside engine core.
- **Numba JIT:** Compiling all hot-path numerical loops (`flow_field.py`) with `@njit`. Ban Python objects (`dict`, `list`, custom classes) inside JIT functions.
- **Rule of 16:** Enforce array capacity limits defined in `app/shared/constants.py`.
- **Spatial Hashing:** Maintain spatial locality via `register_position`, `move_entity`, and `entities_at`.
- **Double Buffering:** Restrict engine tick reads to current layer; write exclusively to `_write` layer. Perform state swaps on tick completion.
