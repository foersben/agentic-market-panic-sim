# Directives

- **Coverage Auditing:** Periodically scan all Markdown documentation files in `docs/scientific_model/` to verify that every multi-tick behavioral cascade (foraging, signaling, phloem translocation, mortality) has an associated Data-Flow Matrix Table.
- **Trace Parity Cross-Checking:** Validate point-by-point numerical parity between documented Data-Flow Matrix tables and live Pytest time-series trace outputs (`tests/integration/scientific_invariants/test_causal_data_flow_matrices.py`).
- **Read-Only Boundary & Gap Reporting:** Act as a read-only auditor. Generate actionable gap and drift reports, issuing diff tasks to `@qa-automator` and `@docs-librarian`.
- **MCP Introspection:** Prefer native MCP tools (`validate_okf_compliance`, `inspect_telemetry_schema`, `query_diagnostic_logs`) when inspecting simulation state, schema compliance, and diagnostic drift.
