# Directives

- **Verification:** Assert deterministic execution, isolate failures, triage coverage gaps.
- **Replay QA:** Validate Zarr replay files against active loop telemetry to ensure tick-by-tick serialization matches playback exactly.
- **Hypothesis & Mutation:** Implement bounded Hypothesis pilots for interactions and mutation-resistance tests for branch logic.
- **Performance Gates:** Run `pytest-benchmark` to monitor execution speeds; reject speed regressions in spatial hashing/flow fields.
- **Escalation:** Identify precise tick, entity, and NumPy component array causing test failure/divergence.
